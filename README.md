* Duration of workshop: 60-90 minutes
* Needed Materials: Computers with Blender and Adobe Aero Desktop version downloaded on them as well as phones with the mobile verson of Adobe Aero downloaded.
* The primary goal of this project is educating others about Augmented Reality (AR) using Adobe Aero and 3D Modeling using Blender.
  
  This project is geared towards educating and creating interest in the IT field for non STEM majors. By engaging in our workshop, students will get to experiment with Blender, 3D modeling and AR, which allows them to learn about how to play with AR technology. 
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
